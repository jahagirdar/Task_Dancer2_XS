http://advent.perldancer.org/2016/12  (Optimizing Dancer2 PT. 1) lists a bunch of XS modules which if installed would be used by Dancer2 instead of the default pure perl versions.
This file provides a single task to download and install all the modules.

# Installation and use.

```
git clone https://github.com/jahagirdar/Task_Dancer2_XS.git
cd Task_Dancer2_XS
cpanm .
```
